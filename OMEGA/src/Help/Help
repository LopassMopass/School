       there will be some terrible resolution.

Token Menu:

Import Tokens:
       If you click or press I, a Token will be imported. Unfortunately I was unable to make it visible at the moment
       of the import, so bear whit me and just click on window mode. Then you will be able to see your token. I will
       try to fix this, but at the moment it is such a mess. I will need to rewrite it all.
